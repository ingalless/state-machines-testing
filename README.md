# State Machines - Traffic Light

In the exploration of state machines, I've created this little app to simulate a traffic light system.

The goal is to have a completely tested app.

## Todo
- [ ] Add assertions for state
- [ ] Add transitions from red back to green
- [ ] Add a "pedestrian" state machine to learn state machine composition?
